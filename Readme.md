# Multi-Agent System with LangGraph and Gemini

This project implements a **multi-agent system** capable of planning, routing queries to the correct tools, and generating answers based on a knowledge base and computational tools.  
The agent is built using the **langgraph** library, with **Google's Gemini Pro** as the core reasoning model.

##  Features
- **Interactive Chat**: Allows users to input queries in a command-line interface.  
- **Multi-Tool Capability**: Integrates several tools, including:
  - **Retriever**: For general knowledge base lookups.  
  - **PolicyLookup**: A specialized tool for company policies and FAQs.  
  - **Calculator**: For safe mathematical computations.  
  - **StringTools**: For extracting patterns from text.  
- **Stateful and Cyclical Logic**: Built on langgraph to manage complex, multi-step conversations.  
- **Structured Logging**: Logs the entire execution flow for each query into a `logs.json` file for easy debugging and auditing.

 ## Agent Logic and Design

This agent is built as a state graph using langgraph, ideal for cyclical and stateful agent runtimes.

ðŸ”¹ State

AgentState: Tracks the history of messages in the conversation.

ðŸ”¹ Nodes

agent: Calls the Gemini model with the conversation history. The model decides whether to use a tool or respond directly.
action: Executes the tool call requested by the model and returns the result.

ðŸ”¹ Edges

Conditional edge (should_continue): If the model requests a tool, execution goes to the action node. Otherwise, it ends.
Loop edge: Connects action â†’ agent so the model can continue reasoning after tool output.

This creates a robust loop:
Think â†’ Act â†’ Observe â†’ Think until the agent has enough information to answer.


## Tool Design and Retriever Choice
Retriever and PolicyLookup
Choice: Simple keyword-based retriever.
Reasoning: Lightweight, fast, effective for a small, well-defined knowledge base.
Enhancements: Searches in both title and text, returns only clean content (no metadata).

## Calculator and StringTools
Calculator: Uses numexpr (safe alternative to Pythonâ€™s eval()).
StringTools: Uses re (regex) for reliable text pattern extraction.

## Assumptions
knowledgeBase.txt is present in the same directory as agent.py.
User has a valid Google API key with necessary permissions.

Queries are in English and are self-contained (donâ€™t rely on separate past queries).
